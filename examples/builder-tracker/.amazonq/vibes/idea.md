# Builder Tracker

## Core Concept
A simple web app that helps developers track their daily coding habits. Users can log what they worked on, how long they spent, and rate their productivity to identify patterns and improve focus.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can log daily coding sessions with project, duration, and productivity rating
- [ ] Simple dashboard shows patterns and trends over time
- [ ] Data persists locally between sessions
- [ ] Clean, fast interface that encourages daily use

## Initial Assumptions
- Developers want to track habits but don't want complex tools
- Local storage is sufficient (no cloud sync needed for MVP)
- Simple metrics (time, productivity rating) are more valuable than complex analytics
- Mobile-friendly design for quick logging on the go

## Context
- **Why now**: Personal productivity tracking for developers is either too complex or too generic
- **Time box**: Weekend prototype, 6-8 hours max
